WagPress Project
================

The goal of the WagPress project is to build a suitable competitor to WordPress,
using fully supported components of the Wagtail Content Management System.

Initially, we're focusing on pulling in 'best of breed' wagtail applications.
We're importing them under the "WagPress" banner so that we can guarantee
full commercial support as we move forward.
